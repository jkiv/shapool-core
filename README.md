# shapool-core

shapool-core is an FPGA core for SHA256d mining (e.g. BTC) for use with
Lattice Semiconductor ICE40 devices using the open-source Project IceStorm
toolchain (http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/).

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the ICE40 devices for mining and
produce a hobbyist/DIY low power FPGA SHA256d miner.
