# shapool-core

**shapool-core** is an FPGA core for SHA256d mining (e.g. BTC) for use with
Lattice Semiconductor [iCE40](https://www.latticesemi.com/iCE40) devices using the open-source [Project IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/)
toolchain.

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the iCE40 devices for mining and
produce a hobbyist/DIY low power FPGA SHA256d miner.

This project aims to support multiple targets including

* [ICE40HX8K-B-EVN](http://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/iCE40HX8KBreakoutBoard.aspx)
* [ICE40UP5K-B-EVN](http://www.latticesemi.com/products/developmentboardsandkits/ice40ultraplusbreakoutboard)
* [jkiv/icepool-board](https://github.com/jkiv/icepool-board)
* ... and others.

Support for [ECP5](https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5) boards using the [Project Trellis](https://github.com/YosysHQ/prjtrellis) open-source toolchain is [planned](https://github.com/jkiv/shapool-core/tree/ecp5) as well.
